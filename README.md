# Introduction
This project aims to create an interactive simulation of a basic pendulum using WebGL. The pendulum will demonstrate the principles of simple harmonic motion, energy conservation, and the effects of varying parameters such as length and mass on oscillation. This simulation will serve as a valuable educational tool to help viewers visualize and understand fundamental concepts in physics.

## Objectives
- Develop an interactive 3D simulation of a basic pendulum.

- Illustrate the principles of simple harmonic motion through graphical representation.

- Allow users to modify key parameters (length, mass, and initial angle) and observe the effects on the pendulum's motion.

- Provide real-time calculations and visual feedback on period and energy transformations.

- Enhance the user experience with intuitive controls.

# Technical Approach
- Framework: Use WebGl for 3D rendering and visualization in the browser.
  
- Algorithms: Implement the equations of motion for a simple pendulum, focusing on angular displacement and velocity.
Use trigonometric functions to calculate the pendulum's position based on time.
Incorporate a damping factor to simulate real-world effects like air resistance.

- User Interface: Create a simple UI for adjusting parameters (length, mass, and initial angle) using HTML with JavaScript for interactivity.

# Potential Challenges

- Physics Accuracy: Ensuring the simulation accurately represents the physics of a pendulum may require fine-tuning of parameters and calculations.

- Performance Optimization: Rendering a smooth animation may require optimizations, especially if adding multiple pendulums or features.
- User Interface Design: Creating an intuitive UI for parameter adjustments that does not overwhelm the user could be challenging.
- Debugging: Identifying and fixing bugs in both the physics calculations and the rendering process might take more time than anticipated.
